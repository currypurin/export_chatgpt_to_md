# Contributing

Thanks for your interest!

## How to contribute
- Open an Issue for bugs, questions, or feature requests
- Submit a Pull Request for fixes / improvements
  - **Please use `develop` as the base branch for your PRs.**
  - `main` is reserved for releases and is protected.

## Development notes
- Please keep changes minimal and easy to review
- If your change is larger, consider opening an Issue first to discuss the approach

## PR checklist
- [ ] Ran the script on a sample `conversations.json`
- [ ] Confirmed Markdown output looks correct
- [ ] Updated README / CHANGELOG if needed
- [ ] PR targets the `develop` branch (not `main`)
